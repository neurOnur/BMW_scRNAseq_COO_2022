Practical on dimensionality reduction and scRNAseq analysis for the BMW course on Bioinformatics at the Utrecht University
**Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data analysis** \

**Principle component analysis (PCA) using prcomp()** \
	Even though dimensionality reduction methods are already integrated in the pipeline, I would like to gain a bit more insight into how the actual code for on of the parts of the analysis looks like. Thus, we will start by performing PCA on single cell data using the prcomp() function, which is part of the ‘stats’ package that is an integral component of R.
